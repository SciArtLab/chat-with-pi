chat-with-pi
========

A user-friendly web service to communicate with a Raspberry pi (send commands, browse directories, play with GPIO...). Oriented to education, 'chat-with-pi' allows collective learning. By using a friendly chat interface, students and professors can share knowledge and practise on a Raspberry pi. Without 'ssh' and in any platform/browser different users can share a real-time updated interface.

* Configure your Raspberry to work with node.js and npm. [Click for help](http://joshondesign.com/2013/10/23/noderpi)

PS. Still working in basic needs.

Enjoy! Help is welcome!
